<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rocket Elevators Mobile is the 14th week project for the Odyssey 14 weeks program in CodeBoxx. 

By this week we had to create a Mobile App that will allow our employees to change the status of the Elevator in `Offline`, `Intervention` or `Maintenance` to
back to `Online`.

A variety of programming lnaguage was suggested to us, I have choose Flutter, for the reason to be a hybrid framework and use the same code for both Mobile OS
systems.

To chaange the status of our elevators, we must use the endpoints on our REST API, developped in C# in the past weeks.
